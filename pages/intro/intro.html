<h1>Blockchain Demo</h1>

A web-based demonstration of blockchain concepts.<br/><br/>
This is a complete rewrite of Anders Brownworth's
  Blockchain Demo with lots of additional features.<br/>
Basically only the idea shown in his <a href="">excellent Demo
  Video</a> remains, the code is completely different.
<br/><br/>

This project is made for only educational purposes to create a dummy blockchain
<br/><br/>

About this website:
<ul>
  <li>Static HTML/JS, so it can be served with GitHub Pages</li>
  <li>Use AngularJS for rendering the page</li>
  <li>Expert Mode that can set difficulty</li>
  <li>Show duration and speed of mining process (in Expert Mode)</li>
  <li>Toggle between TX/Coinbase and Data view</li>
</ul>
